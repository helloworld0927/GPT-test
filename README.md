# Screen Recorder Web App

This is a simple web application that records your screen directly from the browser. It works best on Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge on macOS.

## Features
- Record the entire screen, a specific window, or the current browser tab.
- Optionally include microphone audio alongside the capture.
- Pause and resume the recording at any time.
- Automatic download and preview of the finished video.

Recordings are saved as `webm` files in your browser.

When recording starts the page is highlighted in red and the name of the
captured screen, window, or tab is shown. This helps remind you what is being
captured.

## Usage
Open `index.html` in a supported browser and click **Start Recording**. When you stop the recording you can preview the video and download it to your computer.

Use the **Capture** drop-down to indicate whether you want to record your entire
screen, a window, or just the current browser tab. Your browser will show a
dialog asking you to confirm the selection.
